# Symfony Secrets

This repository contains the vault classes used by Symfony's secrets mechanism as a standalone package.

I created this as a standalone repository to facilitate usage in a separate application independent of the full Symfony framework, and unfortunately the vault classes are part of the framework bundle.

I am in no way claiming credit for this work, and have left the original author attribution in place.
